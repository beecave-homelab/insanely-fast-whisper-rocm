# Constraints file to forbid heavy ML/RL packages during lightweight installs.
# Any attempt by a dependency to install one of these will cause resolution to fail.
# Usage:
#   pip install -r requirements-reviewer.txt -c constraints-no-heavy.txt
# or with PDM:
#   pdm sync -G reviewer --no-editable --no-self -v -c constraints-no-heavy.txt
# (Adjust command to your workflow; key is passing this constraints file.)
