# Lightweight, CPU-only requirements for code reviewers.
# Excludes heavy dependencies like torch, torchaudio, onnx, etc.
# Install with constraints to forbid heavy backends (recommended):
#   pip install -r requirements-reviewer.txt -c constraints-no-heavy.txt
# or with PDM (if mirrored to a group):
#   pdm sync -G reviewer -c constraints-no-heavy.txt
# The constraints file pins heavy packages (e.g., torch, onnxruntime) to
# an impossible version to ensure they are not installed transitively.
