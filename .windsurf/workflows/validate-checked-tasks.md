# Feasibility Check of Checked To-Do Tasks

You are an expert Python code reviewer.

Your task is to analyze whether the **checked tasks** (`- [x]`) in a `to-do/*.md` file are feasible based on the current implementation in the codebase.

## Scope

- Only inspect files **explicitly mentioned** in the `to-do/*.md` file.
- Analyze the **current local codebase** on the **current branch only**.
- **Do not** read or update any existing feasibility reports.
- Use `project-overview.md` for architecture or context if necessary.
- **Do not modify any code** — this task is for analysis and reporting only.

## Tasks

1. Parse the `to-do/*.md` file.
2. If **no tasks are checked**, skip the evaluation and output a brief report stating:
   > No checked tasks found in `<filename>`.
3. For each checked task:
   - Locate the relevant logic in the mentioned file(s), using task wording and file references to find appropriate functions, methods, or modules.
   - Evaluate whether the described functionality is:
     * Fully implemented and aligned
     * Partially implemented or misaligned
     * Missing or not feasible
   - Investigate common issues such as:
     * Missing or incomplete logic
     * Misaligned interfaces or data flows
     * Use of undefined variables, functions, or modules
4. Use `pylint` via CLI or available tooling where helpful. Include relevant linting feedback per task.
5. If the task is not fully feasible (`⚠️` or `❌`), you **must** suggest one or more actionable fixes or improvements.

## Output

* Always create a **new markdown report** in the `to-do/` directory:
  
  ```shell
  feasibility-check-<original-todo-filename>-v<number>.md
  ```

  Examples:

  ```shell
  feasibility-check-auth-module-v1.md
  feasibility-check-auth-module-v2.md
  ```

  Increment the version number on each new run, regardless of content.

* In the report, include the **NL local timestamp** in the header:

  ```md
  ## Feasibility Report

  **Generated**: 2025-05-17 21:12 (NL time)
  ```

- For each checked task:
  - Quote the original task line from the checklist.
  - Provide detailed expert commentary below.
  - Conclude with one of the following markers:
    * ✅ Feasible
    * ⚠️ Partially feasible
    * ❌ Not feasible
  - Justify your conclusion with specific code-level references and reasoning.
