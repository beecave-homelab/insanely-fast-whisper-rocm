  - The structure follows Python packaging best practices

### 1.2 Initial Setup

- [x] **Create new directory structure**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - All specified directories have been created and are properly organized

- [x] **Set up `pyproject.toml` with project metadata and dependencies**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - The file exists and contains comprehensive project metadata
  - Dependencies are properly specified with version constraints

- [x] **Create `.gitignore` file**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - The file exists and is properly configured
  - Includes appropriate exclusions for Python, build artifacts, and environment files

- [x] **Set up pre-commit hooks**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is present and configured
  - Includes hooks for code formatting and linting

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Migration

### 2.1 Configuration

- [x] **Create `config/settings.py` with Pydantic settings**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - The file exists and uses Pydantic for settings management
  - Environment variables are properly handled with defaults

- [x] **Move environment variables to centralized configuration**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Environment variables are managed through the settings module
  - Sensible defaults are provided

- [x] **Implement logging configuration**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Logging is properly configured in `config/logging_config.py`
  - Uses Rich for enhanced console output

### 2.2 Core Modules

#### A. Configuration & Setup

- [x] **Centralize all settings in `config/settings.py`**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Settings are properly organized and typed
  - Environment variable handling is robust

- [x] **Manage logging strategy**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Logging is properly configured with different log levels
  - Rich formatting is implemented for better readability

- [x] **Handle environment variables**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM` is properly managed
  - Other necessary environment variables are handled

#### B. Custom Exceptions

- [x] **Define `TranscriptionError` and `DeviceNotFoundError`**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Exceptions are properly defined in `src/core/transcription.py`
  - Clear hierarchy and meaningful error messages

#### C. Utility Functions

- [x] **Device utilities**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Device detection and conversion functions are implemented
  - Includes proper error handling

#### D. Core Transcription Logic

- [x] **`TranscriptionConfig` and `TranscriptionResult` models**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Models are properly defined with type hints
  - Includes all necessary fields

- [x] **`TranscriptionEngine` class**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Constructor handles initialization and validation
  - `transcribe_audio` method is implemented with proper error handling
  - Includes comprehensive type hints and docstrings

#### E. File Handling & Input Validation

- [x] **Audio file validation**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Supported formats are properly validated
  - Clear error messages for unsupported formats

#### F. Command-Line Interface

- [x] **CLI implementation**
  - ✅ Feasible
  - Click-based CLI is properly implemented
  - Includes all necessary options and validations
  - Rich console output for better user experience

## Summary of Findings

All checked tasks in the restructure project appear to be feasible and properly implemented. The codebase follows Python best practices and includes comprehensive error handling and logging.

### Key Strengths

1. Well-organized project structure following Python packaging standards
2. Comprehensive configuration management using Pydantic
3. Robust error handling with custom exceptions
4. Clean separation of concerns between components
5. Good test coverage for core functionality

### Recommendations

1. Consider adding more unit tests for edge cases
2. Add integration tests for the complete pipeline
3. Document the API and add examples
4. Consider adding performance benchmarks
5. Add type stubs for better IDE support
