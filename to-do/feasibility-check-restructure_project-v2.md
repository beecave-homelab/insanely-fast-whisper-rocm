# Feasibility Report for Project Restructure

**Date:** 17-05-2025 21:18

**Objective:** This report validates the feasibility of the checked tasks in `to-do/restructure_project.md` by analyzing the current state of the codebase.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Structure

- **[x] 1.1 Create Basic Directory Structure:**
  - **Analysis:** Directories `config/`, `src/core/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` exist. Directories `src/utils/`, `src/models/`, `src/exceptions/`, `docs/` were checked in the to-do but `src/utils/`, `src/models/`, and `src/exceptions/` were not found.
  - **Feasibility:** Partially Feasible. Core directories are present, but some planned utility/model/exception directories are missing.
  - **Recommendation:** Create the missing directories: `src/utils/`, `src/models/`, `src/exceptions/`, and `docs/` if still intended.

- **[x] 1.2 Initialize `pyproject.toml`:**
  - **Analysis:** `pyproject.toml` exists and contains project metadata and dependencies.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **[x] 1.3 Create `.gitignore`:**
  - **Analysis:** `.gitignore` exists and is populated.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **[x] 1.4 Setup Pre-commit Hooks:**
  - **Analysis:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists and is configured.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Migration

### 2.1 Configuration Module (`config/`)

- **[x] 2.1.1 `config/settings.py`:**
  - **Analysis:** `config/settings.py` exists and defines `AppSettings` using Pydantic for managing settings.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **[x] 2.1.2 `config/logging_config.py`:**
  - **Analysis:** `config/logging_config.py` exists and sets up logging using Python's `logging` and Rich.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

### 2.2 Core Module Refactoring (`src/`)

- **Task 2.2.1: `src/core/transcription.py` - `TranscriptionEngine`**
  - **Analysis:** `src/core/transcription.py` exists. The `TranscriptionEngine` class and its methods (`__init__`, `transcribe_audio_file`, `_validate_device`, `_init_pipeline`, `_process_output`) appear to be implemented as per the previous review and file content. Pydantic models for config/results are also present.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **Task 2.2.2: `src/core/file_handlers.py` - `FileValidator` and `DirectoryMonitor`**
  - **Analysis:** `src/core/file_handlers.py` exists. The `FileValidator` class and its methods are implemented. The `DirectoryMonitor` class has an initial structure.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **Task 2.2.3: `src/core/conversion.py` - Output Format Conversion**
  - **Analysis:** `src/core/conversion.py` exists. It implements `BaseFormatter`, specific formatters (JSON, TXT, SRT, VTT), and the `convert_transcription` function. The file structure and function signatures align with the task requirements.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

### 2.3 Command-Line Interface (`scripts/cli.py`)

- **[x] 2.3.1 `scripts/cli.py`:**
  - **Analysis:** `scripts/cli.py` exists and uses Click for the CLI entry point.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **[x] 2.3.2 CLI Commands:**
  - **Analysis:** Basic commands for transcription are defined within `scripts/cli.py`.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

## Phase 3: Utilities and Exception Handling

- **3.1 Utility Modules (`src/utils/`)**
  - **[ ] 3.1.1 `audio_utils.py`:**
    - **Analysis:** File `src/utils/audio_utils.py` not found. The `src/utils/` directory itself was not found.
    - **Feasibility:** Not Feasible (File not created).
    - **Recommendation:** Create `src/utils/audio_utils.py` and implement the required audio processing functions.
  - **[ ] 3.1.2 `file_system_utils.py`:**
    - **Analysis:** File `src/utils/file_system_utils.py` not found. The `src/utils/` directory itself was not found.
    - **Feasibility:** Not Feasible (File not created).
    - **Recommendation:** Create `src/utils/file_system_utils.py` and implement helper functions.

- **3.2 Custom Exceptions (`src/exceptions/`)**
  - **[ ] 3.2.1 `custom_exceptions.py`:**
    - **Analysis:** Directory `src/exceptions/` not found, therefore `custom_exceptions.py` also does not exist.
    - **Feasibility:** Not Feasible (File/Directory not created).
    - **Recommendation:** Create `src/exceptions/custom_exceptions.py` and define custom exceptions.

## Phase 4: Data Models (`src/models/`)

- **[ ] 4.1 `transcription_models.py`:**
  - **Analysis:** File `src/models/transcription_models.py` not found. The `src/models/` directory itself was not found.
  - **Feasibility:** Not Feasible (File not created).
  - **Recommendation:** Create `src/models/transcription_models.py` if additional Pydantic models are needed beyond those in `src/core/transcription.py`.

## Phase 6: Testing (`tests/`)

- **[x] 6.1 Setup Basic Test Structure:**
  - **Analysis:** The `tests/` directory exists. The task implies creation of `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`. Further inspection of `tests/` content would be needed to confirm subdirectories, but the main `tests` directory is present.
  - **Feasibility:** Likely Feasible (Main directory exists).
  - **Recommendation:** Verify `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` subdirectories exist or create them.

- **[x] 6.2 Initial Unit Tests:**
  - **Analysis:** This task requires writing tests. The feasibility depends on the actual implementation of tests for `AppSettings` and `TranscriptionConfig` within the `tests/` directory.
  - **Feasibility:** Requires Code Review (Cannot be fully determined by file existence alone).
  - **Recommendation:** Review contents of `tests/` for relevant unit tests.

## Phase 7: Dockerization

### 7.1 `Dockerfile` Refinements

- **[x] 7.1.1 Update Dockerfile:**
  - **Analysis:** `Dockerfile` exists. It appears to be a multi-stage build. The final stages copy local project content (`COPY --chown=rocm-user:rocm-user . .`).
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **[x] 7.1.2 Remove `pipx install insanely-fast-whisper`:**
  - **Analysis:** The `Dockerfile` contains `RUN pipx install insanely-fast-whisper`. This task requires its removal.
  - **Feasibility:** Not Yet Implemented (Action required in Dockerfile).
  - **Recommendation:** Modify `Dockerfile` to remove the `pipx install insanely-fast-whisper` line and ensure dependencies are installed from local sources (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` via `pip install .`).

- **[x] 7.1.3 Ensure Correct `COPY`:**
  - **Analysis:** The `Dockerfile` uses `COPY . .` in the final stage. This copies the entire build context. The earlier stages also copy `requirements.txt`.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible (but ensure context is correct for new structure).

- **[x] 7.1.4 Local Dependency Installation:**
  - **Analysis:** `Dockerfile` includes `RUN pip install -U pip && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`. This handles local dependency installation from `requirements.txt`.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **[x] 7.1.5 Update `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD`:**
  - **Analysis:** `Dockerfile` has `ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]`. The `CMD` is not explicitly set in the final stage, meaning it would rely on the base image or be provided at runtime. For the new structure, it might need to be `CMD ["scripts/cli.py", "--help"]` or similar, depending on the primary entry point.
  - **Feasibility:** Partially Feasible (ENTRYPOINT is generic, CMD needs review/update for new structure).
  - **Recommendation:** Update `CMD` in the `Dockerfile` to execute the main application script (e.g., `scripts/cli.py` or a new main application runner if applicable).

### 7.2 `docker-compose.yaml` Updates

- **[x] 7.2.1 Update `docker-compose.yaml`:**
  - **Analysis:** `docker-compose.yaml` exists.
  - **Feasibility:** Requires Review (Content needs to align with restructured project and Dockerfile changes).
  - **Recommendation:** Review and update `docker-compose.yaml` build context, volumes, and command/entrypoint overrides if necessary to match the restructured project.

- **[x] 7.2.2 Update `docker-compose-dev.yaml`:**
  - **Analysis:** `docker-compose-dev.yaml` exists.
  - **Feasibility:** Requires Review (Content needs to align with restructured project and Dockerfile changes, especially volume mounts for source code).
  - **Recommendation:** Review and update `docker-compose-dev.yaml` similarly to the production compose file, ensuring development-specific configurations like source code volume mounts point to the new `src/`, `config/`, etc., directories correctly.

## Phase 8: Documentation

- **[x] 8.1 Create `README.md`:**
  - **Analysis:** `README.md` exists and contains project information.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **[x] 8.2 Create `project-overview.md`:**
  - **Analysis:** `project-overview.md` exists and provides a detailed project overview.
  - **Feasibility:** Feasible.

- **[ ] 8.3 Update Documentation:**
  - **Analysis:** This is an ongoing task. Both `README.md` and `project-overview.md` currently reflect a mix of old and potentially new structure (e.g., `project-overview.md` shows `src/app.py`, `src/main.py` which might be from before full restructure).
  - **Feasibility:** Partially Feasible (Files exist, content needs updates).
  - **Recommendation:** Thoroughly review and update all documentation to accurately reflect the final restructured project layout, components, and usage instructions.

## Summary of Feasibility

- **Core Structure & Config:** Largely feasible, with minor directory creations needed.
- **Core Logic Migration (Transcription, File Handling, Conversion, CLI):** Feasible, implementations are in place.
- **Utilities, Custom Exceptions, Advanced Models:** Not feasible as corresponding files/directories were not found.
- **Testing Setup:** Basic structure likely feasible, specific tests require review.
- **Dockerization:** Partially feasible. `Dockerfile` exists and installs local dependencies but still uses `pipx install` for the main package and `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD` need alignment. Docker Compose files exist but need review against the new structure.
- **Documentation:** Initial documents exist but require significant updates to reflect the restructured project accurately.

**Next Steps:**

1. Address the 'Not Feasible' and 'Partially Feasible' items, particularly file/directory creation and `Dockerfile` modifications.
2. Conduct a code review for tasks marked 'Requires Code Review'.
3. Update all documentation (`README.md`, `project-overview.md`, and any inline docs) to match the new project structure and functionalities.
