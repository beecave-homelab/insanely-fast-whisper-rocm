# To-Do: Consolidated Analysis of Core vs. Original Implementation

This document consolidates the findings from a three-pass analysis comparing our core API implementation against the original `insanely-fast-whisper` codebase. It serves as a comprehensive summary of architectural differences and provides a structured plan for achieving feature parity and implementing improvements.

## Tasks

- [x] **Analysis Phase:**
  - [x] **Compare High-Level Architecture (CLI vs. Pipeline)**
    - Path: `insanely_fast_whisper_api/core/pipeline.py`
    - Path: `insanely_fast_whisper_api/core/asr_backend.py`
    - External Path: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper/refs/heads/main/src/insanely_fast_whisper/cli.py`
    - Action: Analyze the fundamental architectural differences between the original monolithic script and our modular, object-oriented design.
    - Analysis Results:
      - The original is a monolithic imperative script (`cli.py`), while our codebase uses a modular, object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns (`ASRBackend`, `BasePipeline`, `BaseStorage`).
      - Our architecture enables code reuse for multiple front-ends (API, WebUI, CLI), improves testability, and provides superior features like an event-driven observer pattern for progress tracking, dataclass-based configuration, and centralized error handling.

  - [x] **Compare Model Loading and Configuration**
    - Path: `insanely_fast_whisper_api/core/asr_backend.py`
    - Action: Analyze how model loading, device management, and configuration are handled.
    - Analysis Results:
      - **Model Loading**: The original loads the model immediately at runtime; ours uses a more efficient lazy initialization pattern.
      - **Device Management**: The original has basic device string handling; ours uses a robust `convert_device_string` utility with validation.
      - **Configuration**: The original passes around a raw `argparse` dictionary; ours uses a structured and validated `@dataclass` (`HuggingFaceBackendConfig`).
      - **Optimizations**: Both support BetterTransformer, but our implementation is more resilient to failure.

  - [x] **Analyze Diarization Implementation**
    - Path: `insanely_fast_whisper_api/core/`
    - External Path: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper/refs/heads/main/src/insanely_fast_whisper/utils/diarization_pipeline.py`
    - Action: Assess the diarization capabilities of both codebases.
    - Analysis Results:
      - **Status**: Diarization is fully implemented in the original codebase but is **not yet implemented in ours**.
      - **Infrastructure**: Our codebase contains placeholder infrastructure (e.g., constants), but no active logic.
      - **Original's Method**: The original uses `pyannote.audio` and includes versatile pre-processing for files and URLs.
      - **Identified Risk**: The original's timestamp alignment logic (finding the "closest" timestamp) carries a risk of imprecision that should be addressed in our implementation.

  - [x] **Analyze Result Formatting and Output**
    - Path: `insanely_fast_whisper_api/audio/results.py`, `insanely_fast_whisper_api/core/pipeline.py`
    - External Path: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper/main/src/insanely_fast_whisper/utils/result.py`
    - Action: Compare how final transcription results are constructed and serialized.
    - Analysis Results:
      - **Logic**: The original uses a single `build_result` function. Our logic is distributed across multiple methods (`merge_chunk_results`, `_postprocess_output`), offering more flexibility.
      - **Metadata**: Our output includes richer metadata, such as `pipeline_runtime_seconds` and `config_used`.
      - **Serialization**: Ours defers serialization to a swappable storage layer, while the original handles file I/O directly.

  - [x] **Compare Utility Functions and Error Handling**
    - Path: `insanely_fast_whisper_api/core/errors.py`, `insanely_fast_whisper_api/core/utils.py`
    - Action: Review helper functions and error handling strategies.
    - Analysis Results:
      - **Utilities**: The original has specific helpers for timestamp formatting and language mapping that are currently missing in our codebase.
      - **Error Handling**: The original uses basic exceptions. Ours features a dedicated, hierarchical system of custom exceptions for more precise error management.
      - **Resilience**: Our backend includes a robust automatic fallback from word-level to chunk-level timestamps, a feature the original lacks.

- [ ] **Implementation Phase:**
  - [ ] **Enhance ASR Backend Configuration**
    - Path: `insanely_fast_whisper_api/core/asr_backend.py`
    - Action: Add formal support for Flash Attention 2 in `HuggingFaceBackendConfig`.
    - Action: Implement logic to handle English-only models correctly by removing the `task` argument from `generate_kwargs` where appropriate.
    - Action: Expose generation parameters (e.g., `no_repeat_ngram_size`, `temperature`) in `HuggingFaceBackendConfig` to allow for fine-tuning.

  - [ ] **Implement Diarization Pipeline**
    - Path: `insanely_fast_whisper_api/core/` (via a new module, e.g., `diarization.py`)
    - Action: Implement the full diarization pipeline, potentially as a `DiarizationMixin` or a distinct pipeline step.
    - Action: Develop robust input pre-processing to handle local files, remote URLs, and in-memory bytes.
    - Action: Investigate and implement a more precise timestamp alignment strategy to avoid the potential inaccuracies of the original's method.

  - [ ] **Achieve Utility Parity**
    - Path: `insanely_fast_whisper_api/utils/` (via new modules, e.g., `text_formats.py`)
    - Action: Create helper functions for human-readable timestamp formatting (e.g., for SRT/VTT output).
    - Action: Add a utility for mapping between language names and ISO codes.
    - Action: Ensure the detected language is exposed in the final pipeline result.

- [ ] **Testing Phase:**
  - [ ] **Add Tests for New Features**
    - Path: `tests/`
    - Action: Write unit and integration tests for the new diarization pipeline.
    - Action: Add tests covering Flash Attention, English-only model handling, and configurable generation parameters.
    - Action: Create unit tests for all new utility functions.

- [ ] **Documentation Phase:**
  - [ ] **Update Project Documentation**
    - Path: `project-overview.md`, `README.md`
    - Action: Document the new features, including the diarization pipeline, advanced configuration options, and installation of optional dependencies (e.g., `pip install .[diarization]`).
