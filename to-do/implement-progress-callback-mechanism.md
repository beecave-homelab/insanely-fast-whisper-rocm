# To-Do: Implement Progress Callback Mechanism in ASRPipeline

This plan outlines the steps to implement a progress callback mechanism in the ASRPipeline to provide updates during processing.

## Tasks

- [x] **Analysis Phase:**
  - [x] Research suitable callback patterns for progress updates in Python
    - Path: [insanely_fast_whisper_api/webui/handlers.py]
    - Action: Investigate callback mechanisms or event systems that can be integrated with ASRPipeline.
    - Analysis Results:
      - **Callback Pattern**: A simple functional callback is suitable.
      - **Signature**: `callback(stage: str, current_step: int, total_steps: int, message: Optional[str] = None)`
      - **Integration**:
        - `ASRPipeline.__init__` will accept and store the callback.
        - Callbacks will be triggered during model initialization and at various stages of transcription (chunk processing, overall completion).
        - `handlers.py` will pass the `TranscriptionConfig.progress_callback` to `ASRPipeline`.
    - Accept Criteria: Identify a suitable method for implementing progress callbacks that fits the existing architecture.

- [x] **Implementation Phase:**
  - [x] Add progress callback functionality to ASRPipeline
    - Path: [insanely_fast_whisper_api/core.py]
    - Action: Modify ASRPipeline to trigger callbacks at key processing stages.
    - Status: Done
  - [x] Pass progress_callback from TranscriptionConfig to ASRPipeline
    - Path: [insanely_fast_whisper_api/webui/handlers.py]
    - Action: Update `transcribe` function to pass the callback.
    - Status: Done

- [ ] **Testing Phase:**
  - [ ] Test callback functionality
    - Path: [tests/test_asr_pipeline.py]
    - Action: Create or update tests to verify callbacks are triggered and received correctly.
    - Accept Criteria: Tests pass, confirming that progress updates are sent and received as expected.

- [ ] **Documentation Phase:**
  - [ ] Update project documentation
    - Path: [project-overview.md]
    - Action: Document the new progress callback feature and how to use it.
    - Accept Criteria: Documentation is updated and clearly explains the callback mechanism.
