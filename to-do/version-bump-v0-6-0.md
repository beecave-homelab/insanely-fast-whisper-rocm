# Version Management Plan

## Notes

- User requested analysis to determine if a version bump is needed, referencing the version-management workflow.
- Version bump type should follow semantic versioning and workflow guidelines (analyze recent commits for feat, fix, refactor, BREAKING, etc.).
- Analysis complete: MINOR version bump (0.6.0) required per workflow and recent changes.

## Task List

- [x] Analyze recent changes and commits to determine if a version bump is needed
- [x] Identify appropriate version bump type (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH) if necessary
- [x] Update version in all required files to 0.6.0
- [x] Update changelog and documentation according to workflow
- [x] Tag the 0.6.0 release in git

## Current Goal

Tag the 0.6.0 release in git (no 'v' prefix)
